<h3>Problems with the Datasets</h3>
<a name="problems"></a>
<h4>Explore Amenities</h4>
<p>The items I explored were the 'amenity' and streets. We'll start with 'amenity'. I thought that this might be a place where the value can divert from standard naming conventions.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:amenity">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:amenity</a>, it appears that the convention here is to user lowercase underscored names. I have the following
when I dug into the data using 'play.py'. Below are some of the amenity values and their counts. The rest are <a href="#street_type_data">here</a>.
</p>
<pre>
 khem@mac:~/Documents/code/udacity_reports/data_wrangling_report (master)$ python3 play.py 
 arts_centre =>  1
 parking_entrance =>  1
 preschool =>  1
 community services =>  1
 City Hall =>  1
 fountain =>  1
 social_facility =>  1
 truck_rental =>  1
 picnic_area =>  1
 funeral_home =>  1
 nightclub =>  1
 cinema =>  2
.
.
.
 place_of_worship =>  72
 restaurant =>  78
 school =>  123
 bench =>  255
 parking =>  309
</pre>

<p>There are strays such as 'community services' and 'City Hall'. So the value may 
  not be underscored or it may not exist on. An initial cleanup effort here would be to underscore the fields.
</p> 

<h4>Explore Addresses</h4>
<p>
The other item I looked at are addresses.
We would like to normalize the street types like in the lesson but the streets are not all in a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Karlsruhe_Schema">Karlsruhe Schema</a> style.
There's a mixed bag of that schema and simply using "address" for a tag. For example:
</p>

<pre>
                &lt;tag k="addr:state" v="MA"/&gt;
                &lt;tag k="addr:street" v="Dartmouth Street"/&gt;              
                &lt;tag k="addr:postcode" v="02116"/&gt;
                &lt;tag k="addr:housenumber" v="145"/&gt;
                &lt;tag k="addr:city" v="Boston"/&gt;

                vs.

                &lt;tag k="address" v="200 Nashua Street, Boston, MA 02114"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>An audit shows:
</p>
<pre>
 non-Karlsruhe:  602
 Karlsruhe:  10072
</pre>

<p>
To clean we'll need to dig into both types. The problem would be matching the street type with a decent regex.
It may be worth it to convert those addresses into Karlruhe but I will not pursue that here. The street types exhibit the same issue as in the lesson where. Some data are <a href="#street_type_data">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are street types that are just numbers like "303" from looking at the data. A look at the actual data reveals the value is: First Street, Suite 303. And so there are addresses with secondary address tokenized by possibly commas. This requires a modification of the regular expression used to match the street type. 
For example, we have this data:
</p>
<pre>
 &lt;tag k="address" v="294 Bowdoin Street, Dorchester MA 02122"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>
We need to split this by using "," as the delimiter. This gives us the street of "294 Bowdoin Street".
</p>

<p>
We will discuss cleaning the street types after dealing with amenities.
</p>




<h3>Cleaning Amenities</h3>
<p>
The approach here will be to simply lowercase and underscore the amenity, i.e. replace blank spaces with '_' and lowercase the entire value.
</p>

<p>
For example, for the item with amenity of "City Hall", we now have:
</p>

<pre>
> db.docs.find({"amenity": "city_hall"})
{ ...
  "name" : "Malden Government Center", 
  "amenity" : "city_hall"
  ...
}
</pre>


<h3>Cleaning Street types</h3>
<p>
The streets will be cleaned under two cases. For Karlsruhe schema style addresses, we'll clean it like the examples in this lesson. My new attempt with this report is to look at non-Karlsruhe schema addresses as well. This is done in #shape_non_karlsruhe() in fix.py. We tokenize the string using ',' and break it into 'housenumber', 'street', 'city', 'state', and 'postcode'. We then toss into an 'address' hash just like the fix for Karlsruhe schema style addresses.
</p>

<p>
The example we discussed in the "Explore Addresses" with address of "294 Bowdoin Street, Dorchester MA 02122" will be broken into:
</p>

<pre>
> db.docs.find({"address.street": "Bowdoin Street"})
{ ...
  , "address" : { "street" : "Bowdoin Street", "housenumber" : "294", "postcode" : "02122", "city" : "Dorchester", "state" : "MA" }, 
  ... }
</pre>

<h4>How close are Starbucks shops to Dunkin Donuts on average in this small piece of Boston?</h4>
<p>We first create the indices.</p>
<pre>
db.docs.ensureIndex({"pos": "2dsphere"})
</pre>
<p>
The output of analyze_loc.py gives:
</p>
<p class="answer">
Average distance of closest dunkin donuts to each starbucks:  0.525304289549479 kilometers 
or 0.32640885170164935 miles
</p>

<h3>Other Ideas About the Datasets</h3>
<a name="comments"></a>
<p>
When cross referencing with Google maps and from my own experience of living in Boston, there's some missing data. There are also Dunkin Donuts in train stations and in other super markets. For example, I checked
the Starbucks location at 10 Huntington Avenue (42.3484585, -71.0763809). There's a closer Dunkin Donuts than the one at (42.3722863, -71.0797864). A closer Dunkin Donuts is, 430 Stuart Street, Boston, MA 02116 (42.348748, -71.075219). From the data we have, this does at least tell us that for this piece of Boston, there's a Dunkin Donuts nearby for each Starbucks-- at average of 0.32 miles.
</p>

<p>
Further inspection shows that some of these Dunkin Donuts nodes does not have any address associated with them. Also some nodes appear to be the same location but listed under different users. The data will be improved greatly if there were also addresses associated with them. From the below, we see that 2 out of 5 Starbucks have addresses; and 2 out of 8 Dunkin Donuts have addresses.
</p>

<pre>
db.docs.aggregate([
    {"$match":{ "$and": [ {"name": {"$regex": /starbucks/i}}, {"address": {"$exists": 1} }  ] }   },                
    {"$group":{"_id":"$name", "count":{"$sum":1}}}               
  ])
</pre>

    {"$match":{ "$and": [ {"name": {"$regex": /dunkin/i}}, {"address": {"$exists": 1} }  ] }   },                
    {"$group":{"_id":"$name", "count":{"$sum":1}}}               
  ])
</pre>
<p class="answer">2</p>

<h4>Ideas about improving</h4>

<p>
To address the issue with amenities: A sheme would be to parse the website <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:amenity">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:amenity</a> to find out if the amenity we see (after normalizing by lowercase+underscore) exists in there. That's a programmatic solution to checking it. We then can see what changes can be made can be done to our data if the amenity exists. If not, we'll have to create a new amenity that makes sense and request the site be updated.
</p>

<p>To address the issue of nodes with missing addresses: A scheme would be to request that the user who created
the node to add it by providing him/her with the address. This will be done through Open Street Maps site, namely, the site https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/&lt;username&gt;. You can find the node the user created and write something in the 'discussion' box. The challenge is that this is a manual process with many nodes to deal with like with we have. A programmatic solution of sending a POST request with a suggestion to the user to https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/&lt;id&gt; would be ideal.
</p>

<p>
For our data, the list of users and node id's for Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts without addresses are found with:
</p>

<pre>
> db.docs.aggregate([{"$match":{ "$and": [ {"name": {"$regex": /starbucks|dunkin/i}}, {"address": {"$exists": 0} }  ] } }, {"$project": {"user":"$created.user", "id":"$id" }} ])
{
  "result" : [
    {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5574ff255d0b723a6a8be8d2"),
      "id" : "957119806",
      "user" : "OceanVortex"
    },
    {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5574ff255d0b723a6a8beebd"),
      "id" : "966211184",
      "user" : "OceanVortex"
    },
    {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5574ff255d0b723a6a8bef53"),
      "id" : "966211791",
      "user" : "OceanVortex"
    },
    {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5574ff2b5d0b723a6a8c9de3"),
      "id" : "1979657115",
      "user" : "zacmccormick"
    },
    {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5574ff2d5d0b723a6a8ced1a"),
      "id" : "2428711851",
      "user" : "hopet"
    },
    {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5574ff2e5d0b723a6a8d03b4"),
      "id" : "2623047090",
      "user" : "kisaa"
    },
    {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5574ff2e5d0b723a6a8d17df"),
      "id" : "3230804271",
      "user" : "jwass"
    },
    {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5574ff2e5d0b723a6a8d1b22"),
      "id" : "3310952563",
      "user" : "Ahlzen"
    },
    {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5574ff305d0b723a6a8d5de6"),
      "id" : "29652014",
      "user" : "kisaa"
    }
  ],
  "ok" : 1
}

</pre>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
From our experimentation with this small slice of Boston, we can see that for each Starbucks, there's a Dunkin
Donuts close by (0.32 miles on average). The availability of the latitude/longitude data makes our analysis possible, but there's much more to be desired. Namely, we would like to also have addresses with these coffee shops; and we would like consistent values for amenities. Some programmatic solutions are proposed to address these issues. The issue of cleaning street types for both Karlsruhe schema style and non-Karlsruhe schema style addresses are done in this report.
